Welcome to my website! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs.

My primary research interests are in environmental economics, technology and innovation.

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked as a research professional at the Climate Impact Lab.

<!--
I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from UC San Diego where I received a BA in Economics-Public Policy, a BS in Environmental Systems, and a Master of Public Policy.
In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, watching birds, and taking pictures! Nerdier hobbies include watching anime and playing Magic: The Gathering.
