Welcome! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.

My research centers on environmental and climate economics, with special attention to technology and innovation.

Before coming to Columbia, I worked as a research professional at the Climate Impact Lab. I graduated with honors in Economics from Princeton University and earned an M.A. in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the guitar, going to live gigs, and tending to my basil plants.
